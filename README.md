# Base-L.Settings

Is a single subset, a "Layer" to be utilized in combination with the
[Base-L](https://github.com/hanakin/base-l) framework. [Base-L] follows the
ITCSS guidelines outlined by [Harry Roberts](http://www.csswizardry.com) in
this [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4). This Layer is for
all the default global settings to be included in all the subsequent layers for
the framework.
