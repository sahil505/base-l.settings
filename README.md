# Base-l.settings

Is a single subset, a "Layer" to be utilized in combination with the
[Base-l](https://github.com/hanakin/base-l) framework. The framework is a true
CSS framework following the ITCSS guidelines outlined by [Harry Roberts](http://www.csswizardry.com)
in this [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4). Designed with
applications in mind. Developed in conjunction with the popular open source
forum application [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.org). It lends it self beautifully to
the project improving its code base and simplifying the process of designing and
creating rich, beautiful custom themes.

This Layer is for all the default global settings to be included in all the
subsequent layers for this framework.
